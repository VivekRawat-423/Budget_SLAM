#  Budget SLAM Scanner

A **low-cost DIY SLAM-style scanning system** built using ESP32, dual ToF sensors, and a custom WebSocket-based visualization UI.

> Designed as a fast prototype to explore real-time spatial mapping using minimal hardware.

---

##  Project Overview

- Real-time 2D environment scanning  
- Browser-based radar-style visualization  
- No external software required  
- Fully wireless (WiFi-based)  

---

##  Web Interface

The UI provides:

-  Live scan visualization  
-  Stats (points, min/max distance)  
-  Controls (scale, grid, sweep, etc.)  
-  Logging system  

---

##  How It Works

1. ESP32 scans environment using servo + sensors  
2. Data is streamed via WebSocket  
3. Browser renders a **radar-style map in real-time**  

---

##  Quick Start

### 1. Upload Firmware
- Go to `version1/`
- Flash ESP32 code  

### 2. Open UI
- Open `index.html` in browser  

### 3. Connect
- Enter ESP32 IP  
- Click **Connect**
