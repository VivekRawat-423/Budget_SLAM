#  Budget SLAM (Version 1)

A low-cost 2D scanning system built using **ESP32 + dual VL53L0X sensors + servo**, capable of generating a 360° distance map and streaming it in real-time over WebSockets.

---

##  Features

-  180° servo sweep → full 360° scan using dual sensors  
-  Real-time data streaming via WebSocket  
-  Live point + full scan transmission  
-  Continuous ranging mode for fast updates  
-  Configurable resolution & speed  
-  Built with low-cost components  

---

##  Working Principle

- A servo sweeps from **0° → 180°**
- Two **VL53L0X sensors**:
  - Front sensor → direct angle
  - Back sensor → `(angle + 180) % 360`
- This effectively produces a **full 360° scan**
- Data is:
  - Sent live (`point updates`)
  - Sent as full scan after each sweep

---

##  Hardware Used

- ESP32
- 2 × VL53L0X ToF Sensors
- Servo Motor (SG90 / MG90)
- Jumper wires

##  Data Format

###  Point Data (live)
```json
{"t":"p","a":90,"d":450}
```

 Full Scan
```json
{"t":"s","pts":[[0,300],[1,320]]}
```
 Configuration
```cpp
#define STEP_DEG    2      // resolution (1 = high detail, slower)
#define STEP_DELAY  15     // ms delay per step
#define MAX_DIST    2000   // max valid distance (mm)
```
 WebSocket
```cpp
Runs on port: 81
```
Connect via:
```cpp
ws://<ESP32_IP>:81
```
 How to Run
Flash code to ESP32
Set your WiFi credentials:
```cpp
const char* SSID = "your_wifi";
const char* PASSWORD = "your_password";
```
Open Serial Monitor → note IP
Connect from browser UI

 Notes

XSHUT pins are used to assign unique I2C addresses
Continuous mode improves speed
Data beyond `MAX_DIST` is ignored
